# Webscraping
Web scraping is a technique for extracting data from websites using code or scripts. It can be a 
valuable skill for data collection, analysis, and automation.
It allows to acquire non-tabular or poorly structured data from websites and convert it into a 
usable, structured format, such as a .csv file or spreadsheet.
Scraping is about more than just acquiring data: it can also help you archive data and track changes 
to data online.
